## Course 1: Introduction to Game Design
#### 1. What is a Game?
-   **Genre**: Categories of games based on gameplay mechanics and themes (e.g., RPG, FPS, puzzle).
-   **Fun**: The essential element that drives player engagement and enjoyment.
-   **Game Industry Roles**:
  -   **Game Designer**: Responsible for conceptualizing, planning, and implementing the gameplay, narrative, and overall player experience.

#### 2. Designing Your Game
-   **Pillars of Game Design**: Core principles that shape the game's identity and guide design decisions (e.g., immersion, challenge, creativity).
-   **Game Balance**: Achieving fair and engaging gameplay by balancing difficulty, rewards, and player experience.
  
#### 3. Design Methods
-   **Agile**: Iterative and flexible approach that involves continuous testing and updates.
-   **Waterfall**: A sequential design process with defined stages from start to finish.
-   **Double Diamond**: Two-phase approach focusing on defining the problem and developing solutions.
-   **Market Research**: Identifying target audiences and analyzing market trends to ensure game relevance and appeal.
-   **Iterative Process**: Refining game design through repeated testing and feedback to enhance quality and playability.
-   **Game Design Document (GDD)**: A detailed document that outlines the gameâ€™s mechanics, story, visuals, and technical specifications, serving as the blueprint for the development process.

## Course 2: Fundamentals of Level Design with Unreal Engine
#### 1. **How Level Design Works**
-   **Beats & Intensity:** Structuring moments of high and low intensity to control pacing and player emotions.
-   **Player Engagement Loop:** Maintaining the player's interest through a cycle of challenges, rewards, and progression.
-   **Sensory Elements:** Utilizing:
    -   **Sight:** Visual cues and guidance
    -   **Sound:** Audio for atmosphere and feedback
    -   **Touch:** Tactile feedback (vibration, controller responsiveness)
-   **Core Design Pillars:** Balancing:
    -   **Cognition:** Player's mental processing of objectives and obstacles
    -   **Narrative:** Storytelling through the environment
    -   **Mechanics:** Integrating gameplay systems and interactions

#### 2. **Design Theories**
-   **Level Shaping:** Structuring physical spaces to guide and enhance gameplay flow.
-   **Key Level Components:**
    -   **Enclosure & Cover:** Spaces for strategic movement and protection.
    -   **Gating & Critical Path:** Clear progression paths and gating mechanics to control player movement.
    -   **Biomes & Vista:** Unique environmental styles and visual landmarks for variety and orientation.
-   **Diagrams & Tools for Design:**
    -   **Scale, Legend, Massing:** Basic measurements, symbols, and bulk shapes for rough layouts.
    -   **Greyboxing:** Basic geometry to prototype layout and flow before final art.

#### 3. **Testing & Optimization**
-   **Fault Testing:** Identifying and fixing bugs, unintended paths, or gameplay issues.
-   **Milestones:** Regular checkpoints to review and optimize design choices.
